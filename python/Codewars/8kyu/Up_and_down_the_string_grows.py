# DO NOT INCLUDE COMMENTS IN SUBMITION
# The German character "ß" (Unicode character U+00DF) is a lowercase letter that can be transformed into two uppercase characters "SS". 
# When you convert "SS" to lowercase, it becomes "ss", which is still two characters long. 
# So, in this case, the size of the transformed string "SS".downcase is the same as the size of the original string "ß".
