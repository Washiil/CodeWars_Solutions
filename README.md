# Interview Problem Playbook
Essentially just keeping a log book of my coding problem solving skills. Currently working through leetcode daily problems as well as codewars for fun. Might branch off into more languages as I see fit or necessary.

## Current Focus
My current major focus in on my daynamic programming principles as I find myself brute forcing many of these problems in unintuitive ways rather than forcing myself to understand a more fluid approach.

## Current Languages:
- Python3
- Rust


### Repo `TODO`
- Implement some templating systems to ensure more uniform file names and solution formats.
- Consider some push actions to have a counter in the repo of total problems solved in each language
