# 🚀 LeetCode & Codewars Solutions

Welcome to my repository where I solve **LeetCode** and **Codewars** challenges. I am currently  using **Rust** 🦀 and **Python** 🐍. This repository is a collection of algorithms and data structure problems aimed at improving coding skills, enhancing problem-solving abilities, and sharpening my grasp of data structures and algorithms.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem type and platform for easier navigation. Each solution contains the problem solution and sometimes explanations for tricky or interesting problems.


### Folder Details:

- `rust/`: Rust-based solutions for both LeetCode and Codewars.
- `python/`: Python-based solutions for both LeetCode and Codewars.

For quick reference, each problem-solution file is named based on the problem number or title.

## 📺 Platforms

### [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
LeetCode is the tried and true place for interview coding problems. It offers a vast collection of problems that range from basic to advanced levels, testing algorithmic skills and knowledge of data structures.

### [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
Codewars focuses on various Kata challenges where users are trained to improve their coding skills. Katas are ranked by difficulty, and solutions here are for challenges from `1kyu` to `7kyu` levels.

## 📂 Languages

### Python
Python is a go-to for many people solving coding problems, especially in an interview scenario. Thus, I want to make sure I am confident in my ability to implement many solutions in Python efficiently and quickly.

### Rust 🦀
Rust is a systems programming language focusing on safety, performance, and concurrency. It is ideal for writing efficient and reliable solutions to algorithmic problems. I opted to solve a lot of problems in Rust after Python as a way to continually understand the language and often understand some of the data structures on a deeper level due to the verbose nature of Rust code.

## 🚩 Future Goals 
- [ ] Implement better standardization between all of my solutions
- [ ] Add more languages (Java/C/C++)
- [ ] Perhaps add some benchmarking capabilities for my solutions (Long Term)
- [ ] Add a counter (push action?) to update the number of problems solved in the readme
